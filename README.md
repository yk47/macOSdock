This project demonstrates a Dock UI similar to the macOS dock, implemented using Flutter. It features a horizontally scrollable dock with draggable items, each represented by an icon. The items are arranged with smooth animations that adjust the spacing between them when hovered over.

Features:
Scrollable Dock: The dock allows horizontal scrolling if the total width exceeds the screen size.
Draggable Icons: Users can rearrange icons by long-pressing and dragging them to a new position.
Animated Hover Effects: When hovering over an item, the adjacent icons smoothly expand with padding, creating a dynamic UI interaction.
Customizable Icons: Icons are represented by images fetched from URLs, and the appearance of each icon can be customized through the builder function.

Please use Long Press to drag and rearrange the items in the dock.
